Open an IDLE window and enter the program from Figure 1-7 that computes the area of a rectangle. 
Save the program to a file named rectangle.py and load it into the shell by pressing the F5 key and correct any errors that occur. 
Test the program with different inputs by running it at least three times. 

#input message to get length of edge
length = int(input("Enter the length of an edge: "))
length

#computing surface area with given edge
surfaceArea = 6 * (length ** 2)

#print output
print(surfaceArea)

Write and test a program in a file named circle.py that computes the area of a circle. 
This program should request a number representing a radius as input from the user. 
It should use the formula 3.14 * radius ** 2 to compute the area and then output this result suitably labeled. 

#input message to get length of a spheres radius
radius = int(input("Enter the radius of a sphere: "))
radius

#computing the the sphere's diameter, circumfrence, surface area, and volume
diameter = radius * 2
circumference = 2 * 3.14 * radius
surfaceArea = 4 * 3.14 * (radius ** 2)
volume = 1.33 * 3.14 * (radius ** 3)

#print all output
print("radius = ")
print(radius)
print("diameter = ")
print(diameter)
print("circumference = ")
print(circumference)
print("surface area = ")
print(surfaceArea)
print("volume = ")
print(volume)

A cuboid is a solid figure bounded by six rectangular faces. 
Its dimensions are its height, width, and depth. Write a Python program in a file named cuboid.py that computes and prints the volume of a cuboid, given its height, width, and depth as inputs. 
The volume is just the product of these three inputs. The output should be labeled as “cubic units.”

#input message to get mass and velocity
mass = int(input("enter mass of the object in kilos: "))
mass

velocity = int(input("enter the velocity of the object in meters per second: "))
velocity
#computing the momentum using the numbers given
momentum = mass * velocity

#print output
print("the momentum of the object is ")
print(momentum)
