Compute a person's income tax.

1. Significant constants
       tax rate
       standard deduction
       deduction per dependent
2. The inputs are
       gross income 
       number of dependents 
3. Computations:
       taxable income = gross income - the standard deduction - 
                        a deduction for each dependent 
       income tax = is a fixed percentage of the taxable income 
4. The outputs are
       the income tax

Teachers in most school districts are paid on a schedule that provides a salary based on their number of years of teaching experience. 
For example, a beginning teacher in the Lexington School District might be paid $30,000 the first year. 
For each year of experience after this first year, up to 10 years, the teacher receives a 2% increase over the preceding value. 
Write a program in the file salary.py that displays a salary schedule, in tabular format, for teachers in a school district. 
The inputs are the starting salary, the percentage increase, and the number of years in the schedule. 
Each row in the schedule should contain the year number and the salary for that year. 

# initializing the hour day and year
HOUR = 60
DAY = 24
YEAR = 365

#compute total mins in a year
totalMinsYear = HOUR * DAY * YEAR
print(totalMinsYear, "Total miniutes in a year")

The credit plan at TidBit Computer Store specifies a 10% down payment and an annual interest rate of 12%. 
Monthly payments are 5% of the listed purchase price, minus the down payment. 
Write a program in the file tidbit.py that takes the purchase price as input. 
The program should display a table, with appropriate headers, of a payment schedule for the lifetime of the loan. 
Each row of the table should contain the following items:
the month number (beginning with 1)
the current total balance owed
the interest owed for that month
the amount of principal owed for that month
the payment for that month
the balance remaining after payment
The amount of interest for a month is equal to balance * rate / 12. The amount of principal for a month is equal to the monthly payment minus the interest owed.

HourlyWage = float(input("please enter your hourly wage:$"))
TotalRegHours = float(input("please enter the total regular hours:"))
TotalOvertimeHours = float(input("please enter the total overtime hours:"))
OvertimePay = (TotalOvertimeHours) * (1.5) * (HourlyWage)
TotalWeeklyPay = ((HourlyWage) * (TotalRegHours) + OvertimePay)

print("Their total pay is:$", + TotalWeeklyPay)
