Write a Python program in a file named myinfo.py that prints (displays) your name, address, and telephone number.

print("Donovan Russell,12801 Twisted Oak Rd,918-555-5555")

Open an IDLE window and enter the program from Figure 1-7 that computes the area of a rectangle. 
Save the program to a file named rectangle.py and load it into the shell by pressing the F5 key and correct any errors that occur. 
Test the program with different inputs by running it at least three times.

width = float(input("Enter the width: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height "))
area = width * height
print("The area is", area, "square units.")

Write a program in a file named triangle.py to compute the area of a triangle. 
Issue the appropriate prompts for the triangle’s base and height. 
hen, use the formula .5 * base * height to compute the area. 
Test the program from an IDLE window.

base = float(input("Enter the base: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height "))
area = base * height * .5
print("The area is", area, "square units.")

Write and test a program in a file named circle.py that computes the area of a circle. 
This program should request a number representing a radius as input from the user. 
It should use the formula 3.14 * radius ** 2 to compute the area and then output this result suitably labeled.

radius = float(input("Enter the radius: "))
area = 3.14 * radius **2
print("The area is", area, "square units.")

A cuboid is a solid figure bounded by six rectangular faces. 
Its dimensions are its height, width, and depth. 
Write a Python program in a file named cuboid.py that computes and prints the volume of a cuboid, given its height, width, and depth as inputs. 
The volume is just the product of these three inputs. The output should be labeled as “cubic units.”

height = float(input("Enter the height: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width: "))
depth = float(input("Enter the depth: "))
area = height * width * depth
print("The area is", area, "cubic units.")
